                    This webpage is a StudyBuddy platform designed to solve a critical problem for students: finding the right study partners. In a large academic environment, it can be difficult to connect with peers who share your courses, interests, and study habits. StudyBuddy acts as an essential "group study matchmaker," using a simple yet powerful tech stack to connect students based on their strengths, weaknesses, subjects, and schedules.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The application's front end is built with a combination of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a clean, responsive user interface. To power the intelligence behind the matchmaking and for the chatbot, the backend uses Node.js with the Express.js framework. This is a powerful combination for building a server that can handle requests and process data.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The core of the platform is the AI Engine, which leverages free or affordable APIs like Hugging Face's Inference API or OpenAI. This allows the app to provide smart, personalized recommendations without requiring a massive infrastructure. Student data is currently stored in a simple JSON format, a straightforward approach that's perfect for a project of this scale, ensuring profiles and matchmaking information are always available.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This synergy of simple yet effective technologies makes StudyBuddy an invaluable tool for enhancing the learning experience and fostering collaboration. The chatbot, known as Compiler, takes the form of a friendly dog. This persona is an intentional choice, as dogs are widely seen as comfort animals, making Compiler a comforting presence and a compassionate resource for students seeking guidance.
